          <h3>De Yie Lu</h3>
  <p>I am Malaysian-Taiwanese, born in Penang, Malaysia. Spent 7 years growing up in Jakarta, Indonesia during my primary school years before returning to Penang. I am able to speak English, Mandarin, Malay and Indonesian and still willing to pick up another language in the future such as French.  My hobbies are tenpin bowling, football (soccer) and gaming. I had an interest in IT since I was really young and would explore and play around with my parent’s computer. I also would disassemble electronics which are broken, as I am curious with hardwares and how it’s built.  My experience with IT is quite average with basic to intermediate knowledge in adobe softwares such as photoshop, lightroom, illustrator and premiere, basics in VB.net  and microsoft office a good understanding with excel and the basics of access.</p>

  <p>I am Vietnamese but born in Australia. I enjoy playing table-tennis, spending time with cats and expanding my knowledge of worldwide issues through documentaries and books. My interest in I.T began since I was young due to the influence of family members within the industry. My uncles introduced me to computer functioning and various aspects of I.T systems throughout my childhood. I have completed a certificate I, II and III in Information Technology. I have little official experience in I.T however I am familiar with the hardware and software functioning of computer systems.

  <h3>De Yie Lu</h3>
  <p class="w3-padding-8">In my Myer-Briggs test, I got the personality, Debater (ENTP-A). People with these type of personalities tend to be knowledgeable, quick thinkers, original, excellent brainstormers, charismatic and energetic.</p>
  <p class="w3-padding-8">For my online learning style test, I got 15% auditory, 40% visual and 45% tactile. As from the result, I’m mainly a tactile learner which means I learn best by touching and doing as I learn things best through physical movements, a ‘hands-on’ type of learner. </p>
  <p class="w3-padding-8">The last test that I’ve completed was a leadership style test which shows that I have a communicating vision which indicates that I am able to visualize a clear direction for my group as a leader and able to communicate plans to the group in an exciting manner which helps the group to be more passionate and more willing to achieve the goal as a whole</p>

          <h3>Anh Vu</h3>
  <p>My personality was described as being a virtuoso type (ISTP-A) in the Myer-Briggs test. I was characterised as being introverted, observant, thoughtful, prospective, and assertive.</p>
  <p>My results from the online learning test scored 7 for visual, 3 for aural, 10 for reading/writing, and 6 for kinesthetic.</p>
  <p>The Big Five Personality Test outlined my introverted nature, average emotional stability and agreeableness, a high level of conscientiousness, and an average imagination and intellect</p>
  <p>This may be helpful within a group as it identifies that I tend to be a quiet team member who is more reserved during discussions in the beginning. I may form my own ideas as I observe and think within a team then communicate my opinions after.</p>

  <h3>Dan Nguyen</h3>
  <p>For the Myers-Briggs test, my personality is The Consul Personality (ESFJ-A). Here it shows i am highly extroverted, observant, emotional, judging and assertive. </p>
  <p>The online learning style test shows I can learn well under conditions of Visual, Read/Write and Kinesthetic, scoring points of 12 for each. However under Aural, I scored a 9, suggesting it is not my most favourable learning method.</p>
  <p>The final test was a Big Five Personality test which displays my openness and agreeableness with others allowing myself to be flexible with other ideas. My results of extraversion support my results in the Myer-Briggs test of being outgoing and being a “people person”.</p>

  <h3>Jon Nguyen</h3>
  <p>The results received from the Myer-Briggs test have predicted that i belong under “The Adventurer” personality. Through these results, it can be determined that i am an introverted individual who is very observant as and assertive</p>
  <p>From the percentages provided by the learning style test, i fall under the category of a Visual learner, incorporating the use of pictures and diagrams in order to learn.</p>
  <p>The last test completed was a creativity test which placed my creativity score below the average standard. From these results, it is clear that i have an ability to carry large quantities of information and am able to manipulate and manage the relationships between such information where as i am lacking in curiosity and perspective which involves the ability to shift perspectives on a situation and the desire to change or improve things that everyone accepts as the norm.</p>
